One very significant application of the graph data structure involves social media. Facebook changed the future of social media years ago when they began using graphs to store their data. This connects a particular person, place, page, etc., with posts, pictures, likes, and relationships. It allows for a user to search for pages that have liked certain things and also are from a certain region, for example. Every post, page, person, or place is stored as a vertex and the connections between those vertices (likes, comments, high schools, hometowns, etc.) are stored as edges. In this way Facebook has a highly effective search algorithm in which people can connect with exactly what they are looking for in an efficient manner.
